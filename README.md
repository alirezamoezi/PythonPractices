# PythonPractices
Some python practices that I did at school.
These are the questions:

Q1. Write a Python program to find the median among three given numbers.

Q2. Write a python program that reads an integer, namely n, from user and prints out the prime numbers between 1 and n. You can read about prime number from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

Q3. Write a Python program that reads two integers from user and prints out the “greatest common divisor” between these numbers. You can read about ‘greater common divisor’ from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor

Q4. Write a Python program to that reads a temperature in Fahrenheit degrees as a float number from user and converts it to Centigrade degrees.

Q5. Write a Python program to get all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length n. A strobogrammatic number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric, so that it appears the same when rotated 180 degrees. In other words, the numeral looks the same right-side up and upside down (e.g., 69, 96, 1001).
For example,

Given n = 2, return ["11", "69", "88", "96"].

Given n = 3, return ['818', '111', '916', '619', '808', '101', '906', '609', '888', '181', '986', '689']
